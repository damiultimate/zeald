Zeald PHP Tests (Short Version)<br>
I have only included the files i edited. They are export.php, classes/Controller.php, classes/Export.php, a new file classes/FormatHelper.php (helper class for the exporting process) and an interface that the FormatHelper class will implement. This interface must be implemented when creating any format helper and will help developers know the necessary methods required. It can be found in the interface/HelperInterface.php.

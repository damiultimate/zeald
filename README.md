Zeald PHP Tests (Short Version)<br>
I have only included the files i edited. They are export.php, classes/Controller.php, classes/Export.php, a new file classes/FormatHelper.php (helper class for the exporting process) and an interface that the FormatHelper class will implement. This interface must be used when creating any format helper so all the methods will be implemented (The XML(), CSV(), JSON() and HTML() ). It can be found in the interface/HelperInterface.php.
